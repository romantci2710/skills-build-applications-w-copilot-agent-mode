        "In today's rapidly evolving technology landscape, businesses frequently need to conduct comprehensive research and analysis that spans multiple data sources, requires complex reasoning, and demands clear actionable insights. Whether it's market research, competitive analysis, urban planning, or scientific research, the challenges remain similar: how to efficiently gather, process, and synthesize information while ensuring accuracy and scalability.\n",

        "### Learning Through Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than using existing frameworks, we'll build our multi-agent system from scratch. This approach offers several benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Core Understanding**: Building from the ground up helps you understand the fundamental principles of multi-agent systems\n",
        "2. **Design Pattern Mastery**: Learn reusable patterns that work across different domains and technologies\n",
        "3. **Custom Control**: Gain the ability to fine-tune every aspect of your system\n",
        "4. **Debugging Confidence**: Understanding the internals makes troubleshooting much more straightforward\n",
        "\n",
        "While there are excellent open-source frameworks available for building multi-agent systems, such as [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI), [PydanticAI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai), and [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), we believe that a from-scratch approach in this notebook will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The open-source frameworks offers many valuable features like conditional routing, annotated global state, checkpointing, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you've grasped the fundamentals from this notebook, exploring these frameworks can unlock even more advanced capabilities and streamline your development process.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Technical Components\n",
        "\n",
        "Our implementation showcases essential Vertex AI ***Gemini 2.0*** capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Function Calling**: Structure agent behaviors and interactions\n",
        "2. **Structured Output**: Generate consistent, validatable data\n",
        "3. **Async Operations**: Handle parallel agent tasks efficiently\n",
        "4. **Google Search Integration**: Ground agent reasoning in real-world data\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### To get started, let's explore some key questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* What exactly is an agent, and how does it differ from a simple LLM call?\n",
        "* How can agents use tools to achieve their goals?\n",
        "* And what possibilities emerge when multiple agents work together in a multi-agent system?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **LLM Execution (The Foundation)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of an LLM as a powerful prediction engine. Given some input text (a prompt), it predicts what comes next, generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way. However, on its own, it simply reacts to your input and provides an output. It doesn't have a sense of purpose or the ability to act independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** An LLM is like a super smart travel guidebook. You ask it \"What are some popular attractions in Paris?\" and it gives you a list. It provides information but doesn't actually do anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "![title](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/generative-ai/gemini2/use-cases/research_multi_agent_ev/img/simple-llm-flow.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Agent (LLM with a Purpose)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, imagine giving that prediction engine some goals and the ability to act on them. This is essentially what an agent is. It's an LLM wrapped with extra code that allows it to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Understand the goal:** \"Book a flight to London.\"\n",
        "* **Break it down into steps:** Search for flights, compare prices, choose a date, make a booking.\n",
        "* **Use tools to achieve those steps:** Access a flight booking API, a web browser, or even interact with a human.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** An agent is like a personal travel assistant. You tell it \"Plan a trip to Paris for me next month.\" The agent uses its LLM \"brain\" to understand what that means, then uses tools like flight booking websites, hotel search engines, and even weather apps to create an itinerary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "![title](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/generative-ai/gemini2/use-cases/research_multi_agent_ev/img/agent-flow.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Multi-Agent (Teamwork Makes the Dream Work)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, imagine several of these specialized agents working together, each with its own skills and responsibilities. That's a multi-agent system. They can communicate, share information, and coordinate their actions to achieve a complex goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** Now imagine a team of specialized travel agents working together. One agent books the flights, another finds the perfect hotel, a third arranges tours and activities. They communicate and coordinate to create an amazing Paris trip.\n",
        "\n",

        "2. **Structured Data Model:** This fetched data is stored in a structured format. For example, `summary.area_metrics.total_area` is a specific field in our data model that holds Austin's total area.\n",
        "3. **Citation Tracing:** Citation 1 clearly links the numbers in the text to their source in the data model. The `data_path` field shows where to find the data (e.g., `summary.area_metrics.total_area`), and the `raw_value` field reveals the exact value fetched from the API (\"1679.20\").\n",
        "4. **Dynamic Content Generation:** When the report is generated, the system automatically pulls the relevant data from the model, based on the `data_path` specified in the citation, and inserts it into the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is this important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Accuracy:** Our report is based on real data from trusted APIs, not on manual input, minimizing errors.\n",
        "*   **Traceability:** We can always trace the data back to its source, ensuring transparency and verifiability.\n",
        "*   **Automation:** The `DataGatherAgent` and our structured data model automate the data retrieval and integration process, making it efficient.\n",
        "*   **Consistency:** This structured approach ensures consistency across the report, as all agents use the same data model.\n",

        "In essence, the normal section demonstrates the power of our data-driven approach. The `DataGatherAgent`, our structured data model, and the `CitationData` system work together seamlessly to create a report grounded in accurate, traceable, and automatically updated information. This highlights the core strength of our multi-agent system: its ability to leverage structured data to produce reliable and insightful analysis.\n",

The clear link between generated content and underlying data via CitationData ensures data integrity and transparency. Furthermore, the design is extensible, accommodating future growth and new types of analysis without disrupting the core structure, making it ideal for a multi-agent system."
